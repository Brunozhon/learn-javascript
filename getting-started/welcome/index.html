title: Welcome to JavaScript!

<p><span class="lead">We will be learning about <i>lexical structure</i>,</span> the first thing you should learn. It's the set of rules that define how you write a program.</p>

<h2>Text</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a <i>case-sensitive</i> language. This means that language keywords, function names, variables, and other <i>identifiers</i> must always be typed with a consistent capitalization. The <code>while</code> keyword, for example, can only be typed all in lowercase, that is, <code>while</code>, and not <code>While</code> or <code>WHILE</code>.</p>
<p>JavaScript ignores spaces between <i>tokens</i> in programs. Usually, JavaScript ignores line breaks, but there are a few special cases. Because you can use spaces and newlines freely, you can format and indent your code to be nice and easy to read. For example, which code is easier to read?</p>
<pre>
           var         x         =           2      +                  3            ;
</pre>
<pre>
var     x     =     2     +     3     ;
</pre>
<pre>
var x = 2 + 3;
</pre>
<pre>
varx=2+3;
</pre>
<p>The third looks best, of course. The fourth, however, is the worst. The JavaScript interpreter would interpret <code>varx</code> as a variable's name instead of <code>var x</code>. JavaScript also recognizes tabs, ASCII control charcters, and various Unicode whitespace.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>JavaScript supports two types of comments. Any text between <code>&#47;&#47;</code> and the end of the line is treated as a comment and ignored by JavaScript. Any text between <code>&#47;*</code> and <code>*&#47;</code> is treated as a comment, too. Comments can't be nested. These are valid comments:</p>
<pre>
&#47;&#47; This is a comment
&#47;* These are *&#47; &#47;&#47; comments, too.
&#47;*
 * Comments can span multiple lines, too. The
 * stars at the start of each line aren't
 * required, but they look nice and neat!
*&#47;
&#47;*
See?
*&#47;
</pre>

<h2>Literals</h2>
<p>A literal is a data value, like <code>"Hello!"</code> or <code>3.1415926</code> appearing directly in a program. They will be explained later.</p>

<h2>Identifiers and Reserved Words</h2>
<p><i>Identifiers</i> are used to a name functions, variables, constants, properties, methods, and classes. An identifier can start with a letter, an underscore, or a dollar sign. These are all valid:</p>
<pre>
x
slithering_snake
theBigCamel
$IHave
</pre>
<h3>Reserved Words</h3>
<p>Like all languages, JavaScript has reserved words. They are:</p>
<pre>
as
aync
await
break
case
catch
class
const
continue
debugger
default
delete
do
else
export
extends
false
finally
for
from
function
get
if
import
in
instanceof
let
new
null
